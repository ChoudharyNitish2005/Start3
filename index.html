    <h3 id="Topic1">WHAT IS DINOSAUR</h3></h3>
    <p class="p1">Dinosaurs are prehistoric reptiles that have lived on Earth from about 245 million years ago to the present. Modern birds are one kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.</p><br>
    <p class="p1">The feature that distinguishes dinosaurs from other reptiles is a hole in the hip socket, which allowed dinosaurs to walk upright. Pterosaurs, or flying reptiles, and plesiosaurs, ocean-dwelling reptiles, did not have this feature and were not dinosaurs.</p><br>

    <p class="p2">Dinosaur communities were separated by both time and geography. The 'Age of Dinosaurs' (the Mesozoic Era) included three consecutive geologic time periods (the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods). Different dinosaur species lived during each of these three periods. For example, the Jurassic dinosaur Stegosaurus had already been extinct for approximately 80 million years before the appearance of the Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus. In fact, the time separating Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is greater than the time separating Tyrannosaurus and you.</p><br>
    <p class="P3">At the beginning of dinosaur history (the Triassic Period), there was one supercontinent on Earth called Pangea. Many dinosaur types were spread across it. However, as Pangea broke apart, dinosaurs became scattered across the globe on separate continents, and new types of dinosaurs evolved separately in each geographic area.</p><br>
    <h3 id="Topic3">FACTS</h3>
    <p class ="left">1.Speediest</p>
    <p>The speediest dinosaurs were the ostrich mimic ornithomimids, such as Dromiceiomimus, which could probably run at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour.</p><br>
    <p class="left">2.Heaviest</p>
    <p>The heaviest dinosaur was Argentinosaurus at 77 tonnes. It was the equivalent to 17 African Elephants. Argentinosaurus is a double award winner being also the longest dinosaur. It is also the largest land animal to have ever lived.</p><br>
    <p class="left">3.Most Intelligent </p>
    <p>One of the most intelligent dinosaurs was Troodon. It was a hunting dinosaur, about 2 metres long, and had a brain size similar to that of a mammal or bird of today, stereoscopic vision, and grasping hands.</p><br>
    <p class="left">4.Most Ferocious</p>
    <p>Tyrannosaurus rex looked the most ferocious of all the dinosaurs, but in terms of overall cunning, determination and its array of vicious weapons it was Utahraptor that was probably the fiercest of all. Utahraptor measured about 7 metres, and was a very powerful, agile and intelligent predator.</p><br>
    <p class="left">5.Tallest</p>
    <p>The tallest dinosaurs were the Brachiosaurid group of sauropods. Their front legs were longer than the rear legs giving them a giraffe-like stance. This combined with their extremely long necks, which were held vertically, meant they could browse off the tallest trees. Brachiosaurus - the most well known of the group - was 13 metres tall. Sauroposeidon was massive and probably grew to 18.5 metres tall making it the tallest dinosaur.</p><br>
    <p class="left">6.Dumbest</p>
    <p>Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a walnut - only 3 centimetres long and weighing 75 grams. However, comparing brain size to body size sauropodomorphs, like Plateosaurus, were probably one of the dumbest dinosaurs.</p><br>
    <p class="left">6.Oldest</p>
    <p>The oldest known dinosaur is Saltopus. It was a small carnivore that lived 245 million years ago. Remains of this dinosaur have only been found in Scotland, so the UK might hold the key to the origin of dinosaurs.</p><br>
    <p class="left">7.Tallest</p>
    <p>The tallest dinosaurs were the Brachiosaurid group of sauropods. Their front legs were longer than the rear legs giving them a giraffe-like stance. This combined with their extremely long necks, which were held vertically, meant they could browse off the tallest trees. Brachiosaurus - the most well known of the group - was 13 metres tall. Sauroposeidon was massive and probably grew to 18.5 metres tall making it the tallest dinosaur.</p><br>
    <h3 id="Topic4">EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAUR</h3>
    <p>Earth has experienced five events when at least 75% of all species died out over a short amount of geological time. The most recent of those 'Big Five' mass extinctions occurred 66 million years ago (MYA). While famous for killing the dinosaurs, the fifth mass extinction also shaped the wildlife we see today</p><br>
    <p>While there are several controversial explanations, the leading theory for the actual 'kill mechanism' is that a 10km-wide asteroid smashed into Earth, leaving a crater 180km across at Chicxulub in Mexico. A thermal pulse from heated debris spread across the globe, while the force of collision â€“ equivalent to millions of atomic bombs â€“ created shockwaves that triggered earthquakes, then tsunamis and wildfires.</p><br>

      <p>The impact launched a vast dust cloud into the atmosphere, which coincided with gas released from volcanic activity and blocked-out the sun for years. That led to a nuclear winter and limited photosynthesis, which ultimately powers most life, and that in turn caused a collapse of our planet's ecosystems.</p><br>
